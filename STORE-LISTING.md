**AgentBridge — Connect AI Agents to Your Browser**

## Short description (132 chars max)

```
Connect AI agents to your browser: read the tab, read/write the clipboard, inject text — every action needs your approval.
```

## Detailed description

```
AgentBridge is a free, local bridge between AI agents and your Chrome browser.

It gives your AI assistant a safe, approved way to see and act in your browser:

• Read the active tab — see the page title and URL
• Read the clipboard — grab the text you copied
• Write the clipboard — put text there ready to paste
• Inject text — type into the focused field on any page

Every single action needs your approval. Nothing runs automatically. When an agent asks for something, you get a notification with Approve and Deny buttons. No approval, no action — ever.

Why you would want it: your AI agent can check which page you are on, prepare an email, a form answer, or a code snippet, and place it into the right field — with you approving each step.

How it works: the extension connects to a tiny local bridge server on your own machine (127.0.0.1:8788). Your agent connects to the same server. The server only routes messages between the two — it never sends anything to the internet.

Private by design: all traffic stays on your computer, on the loopback interface. No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry, no data collection.

Free, and compatible with any agent that speaks WebSocket — the message protocol is simple and documented.

## Screenshot plan (3–5 shots)

1. **Extension popup — connected state:** bridge status (connected) + approval count.
2. **Approval notification:** Chrome notification with Approve / Deny buttons for an incoming request — the human gate.
3. **Agent client terminal:** a small WebSocket client sending a `readTab` request and printing the approved result.
4. *(optional)* **Clipboard roundtrip:** agent writes text, reads it back.
5. *(optional)* **Inject demo:** agent text typed into a focused form field after approval.

## Single-purpose statement

AgentBridge exists for one purpose: to let AI agents read your active tab and clipboard and inject text into a page, with your explicit approval on every action. It does nothing else — no ads, no accounts, no tracking, no other features.

## Permissions justification

| Permission | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Read the active tab's title/URL for an approved `readTab`. |
| `clipboardRead` | Read clipboard text for the approved `readClipboard`. |
| `clipboardWrite` | Write text to the clipboard for the approved `writeClipboard`. |
| `scripting` | Inject text into the focused element for the approved `inject`. |
| `storage` | Store the approval count and bridge status locally. |
| `notifications` | Show the approval notification with Approve/Deny buttons. |
| `alarms` | Keep the service worker alive so the extension stays connected. |
| `host_permissions: <all_urls>` | Agents act without a user gesture, so the extension must reach any page the user has open. The approval gate is the control that makes this safe. |

## Privacy

- Data stays local: bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback only). No cloud, no accounts.
- No telemetry, no data collection.
- Touches tab titles/URLs, clipboard text, and injected text — all processed on your machine only.
- Approval count stored in local browser storage, on your device only.
